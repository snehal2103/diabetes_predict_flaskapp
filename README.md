## Diabetes Predictor
## Description
The Diabetes Predictor is a machine learning-based application that assesses the risk of diabetes in users based on various health metrics. By utilizing the Puma India dataset, this project aims to provide accurate predictions and insights into diabetes risk, making it a valuable tool for health awareness.

## Features
Good Prediction Accuracy: Utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to deliver reliable predictions.
User-Friendly Interface: Built with Flask, ensuring a smooth user experience.
Fast and Scalable: Designed to handle multiple users with quick response times.
Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for developing the machine learning model and web application.
scikit-learn: Library for machine learning, used for model training and evaluation.
Flask: Web framework for building the application.
Pandas: Library for data manipulation and analysis.

## Dataset
The project uses the Puma India dataset, which includes various health metrics relevant to diabetes risk assessment. The key metrics in the dataset are:

Age: Age of the individual (in years).
Gender: Gender of the individual (male or female).
BMI (Body Mass Index): A measure of body fat based on height and weight.
Blood Pressure: Systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings.
Glucose Levels: Fasting blood glucose levels (mg/dL).
Insulin Levels: Insulin levels (ÂµU/mL).
Diabetes Pedigree Function: A function that scores the likelihood of diabetes based on family history.
Outcome: Target variable indicating whether the individual has diabetes (1) or not (0).
